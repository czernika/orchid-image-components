# Orchid Image Components

[![Tests](https://github.com/czernika/orchid-image-components/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/czernika/orchid-image-components/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

Adds new image components to preview uploaded (or external) images for Laravel [Orchid](https://orchid.software/) admin panel. Mostly used for "show" type screens where presentation may be important

## Compatibility

| Version | PHP          | Laravel | Orchid |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------|
| 2.x     | 8.1/8.2/8.3  | 10.x    | 14.x   |
| 2.x     | 8.2/8.3      | 11.x    | 14.x   |

**TODO** It definitely works on both Laravel 10 and 11 but I screwed up my workbench test workflow so everything fails... Oops! Need to re-workbench again
